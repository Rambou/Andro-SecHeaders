#Android SecHeaders

##Info
An app for android 4.1+ that takes as an input some websites and then gathers, filter, visualize and generate statistics of their Security Headers. It's started as a mini-project for the course of "Mobile and Wireless Networks Security" at the Department of Information & Communication Systems Engineering, University of Aegean. So don't expect anything fancy lads. :bowtie:
